*INSTALL BABEL PACKAGE SO YOU CAN WRITE JSX CODE IN YOUR TEXT EDITOR*

* To do this, begin by opening the Sublime package installer (Type: `ctrl/cmd+shift+p` Enter: `Install Package`).

* From here, search for the package called `Babel` and hit enter to install. Once the installation is complete close and restart Sublime.

* Create and save a generic JavaScript file.

* Then navigate through the top menu of Sublime -> `View` -> `Syntax` -> `Open All with Current Extension` -> `Babel` -> `JavaScript (JSON)`. This will configure Sublime to always use the Babel compiler when working with any JavaScript file (ES6, React JSX, etc.)
